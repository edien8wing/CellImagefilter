# CellImagefilter
a easy Image filter for cell recognize?

a demo algorithm for cell recognize .Microscopic images are prone to tend to dark angles.And this phenomenon is subtle and not easily visible to the naked eye.If the usual color threshold algorithm is used. Many points will be discarded。


Two simple algorithms are provided here.
 the one is edge detection realized by Convolution algorithm 
 
 and an other algorithms is another idea。
 program cut the image to serval pices . then it calculate the sum of all the point of the little picess. if this point is higher than the average Multiply a Immutable rate hold this point.
 
 the number of the pices depends  Conversion Rate of Dark Angle. Usually speaking the same parameter and the same Environmental went change the Conversion Rate of Dark Angle.
